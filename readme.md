## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Css

### Time required

It took me nearly the hold day to place all the items in its place and complete the project.

### What I learned

This is the css design code snippet of the hero container section, through which i got more clear on attribute selector and position.

```css
[aria-label="banner"] .hero-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  gap: 1.5rem;
  position: relative;
}

.square {
  position: absolute;
  top: 40%;
  left: 8.5%;
}
.globe {
  position: absolute;
  top: -7%;
  left: 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

I have still a lot to grab on positioning elements. The design page here is static and responsiveness is still pending.
